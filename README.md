# minqlx-plugins
This is a collection of plugins for [minqlx](https://github.com/MinoMino/minqlx).
The Python dependencies are included in requirements.txt. Make sure you do a
`pip3.5 install -r requirements.txt` first. Replace `pip3.5` with whatever
Python 3.5's pip is called on your system.

The extras directory contains plugins I would not advice you use unless you further improve them or
just use them for the purpose of learning.

More info will come, including a small explanation of what the plugins do and perhaps
some info on what will come. Right now I'm just trying to get it all on git first.
